How Demultiplexing (striping the packets of the header and forwarding to the right protocol) Works
    - Host receives IP address:
        - each packet has a source IP address,
        destination IP address.

        - each packet carries one transport layer segment

        - each segment has a source, destination port number


UDP:
    - Original proposal:
        - Only 3 pages; describes fully; formatting; fields
        - Thin layer between IP and Application layer.
    
    - Largest size of UDP packet:
        - 65535 - 8  = 65527
    
    - Thechecksum checks that the message came to the layer as expected.
        - Useful as errors can get in the packet, due to outside factors.
        - Checked at:
            - IP
            - TCP/UDP/ICMP
    
    UDP use:
        - streaming multimedia apps(loss tolerant, rate sensitive)
        - DNS, DHCP, NTP, SNMP

        - You can have reliability but has to be provided by the application.
