WEP
    - Wired equivalent privacy.

Wired may be more controlled, there are ways to extract data.
    - Speed bandwith is much faster tha wireless.


ASDL/Cable/Fiber
    - Fiber is the fastest but also most expensive.

Ethernet
    - Cat5
    - Cat6

802.11 (Wi-Fi)
    - b/g/n/ac
    - 802 is a standard. 11 means wifi. 16 is bluetooth.

3G/4G/LTE/WiMax
    - Very expensive to cover large countries such as the U.S

Why do we need connection?
    - pass

ISP
    - Internet Service Provider

IXP
    - Internet Exchange Point

PACKETS:
    LAYERS:
        Application
        Transportation
        Internet
        Link
        Physical

    Application can produce large messages, that are often broken into small chunks.
    That is the whole idea of the internet. Packet switching (message is broken into smaller pieces) vs Service switching. In the sixties
    if we wanted to connect to other nodes that were already connected in a circuit, it was a problem.

    The small chunks (packets). In most cases all the packets will take the same route.They are forwarded across muultiple links from source
    to destination.
    It is not a job for a router to reassemble the message. The reassemly is done at the destination, and it has not to 
    do with encryption that routers can not assemble the message.

    DELAYS:
        - What causes delays?
            - Distance.
            - 
    
    PACKET LOSS:
        - Not common nowadays.
        
    QUEUES & BUFFERS
        - Build a queue and a backlog of packets as they arrive.

    ROUTING
        - Kind of a best route algorithm.


    CDN
        - Content Delivery Network



Quality of Service
    - From Source to next point limitations are distance (physics).
    Processing delay (less than a microsecond); negligible. 
        Reading and updating the packet.
        Error checking.
    
    QUEIENG DELAY:
        - The most challenging part of this process is the Queeing delay. Happens on devices between
    source and destination as those devices might have queue of packets to process. Traffic is random. It comes
    in bursts.

    Packets can be flagged which nrings the challenge of ordering how they should be delivered and treated
    as urgent by routers. Priority Queues? Yus. Some packets will be dropped. 
        When is it ok for packets to be dropped?
            Live videos; videos.
        
        How many packets can you drop in a tolerable manner?

    TRASMISSION DELAY:
        - How fast can it push the pakets into the wire?
        (size of packet/width of your connection) = time in which it can be trasmitted.
        Has to do with the output capacity of the device you are using.
    
    PROPAGATION DELAY:
        - PHYSICS!! Has to do with the distance between two devices.







    
MY TAKEAWAYS:
    - Internet is a suitable service to perform graphs algorithms.
        - BFS; DFS; Djikstra;

    - Is mobile network not connected to the internet?
