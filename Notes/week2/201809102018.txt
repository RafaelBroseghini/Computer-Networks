MAC address (Hardware address): Media Access Controller

What happens when we boot the machine and surf to a web page from a network perspective?
    - Network card. The basic thing that the machine knows about the environmet is its MAC address.
    This address identifies the card within the local network.

    - (DHCP) Machine broadcasts a message to the local network basically asking for its ip address.
    At least one machine in the network responds to your broadcast. 
    (port:68) And serves the ip address to the requester, dns srver, mask, gateway address.

    - If no response comes back, your machine makes up an IP address (useless) (169.254....). Not a good
    sign. Expected response from DHCP server but it never came back.

    - At this point your machine knows how a lot about the network but maybe not the gateway's MAC address.
    The machine uses the ARP protocol to find it. The gateway responds alone, not someone else. Because
    if you have some machine that asks to another machine, the requested machine responds.

    - Machine must resolve the name (url/uri) of the destination into computer readable content (numbers).
    DNS server (Domain name system) may be out of the local network. If it is out it must go through the gateway.
    When the response comes back, we finally know what is the specific address of our destination.

    - 3 way handshake (Transport Layer Protocol)

    - GET request. Response with content. (There may be some redirections.)
