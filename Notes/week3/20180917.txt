Application Layer Protocol Needs
    - Data integrity:
        - Guaranteed delivery vs loss tolerance

    - Timing:
        - Small miliseconds is often negligible.
        - Delay:
            - time it takes for a packet to get from one
            place to another. many variables that play into it.
        - Jitter:
            - Google this.

    - Throughput:
        - Guaranteed:
            - Google this.
        - Elastic:
            - Google this.


WEB HISTORY
    - Early years:
        - Text-based.

    - Dotcom bubble:
        - Broadcast
        - Dotcomcities


    - Survivors:
        - Amazon
        - eBay
        - Google


HTTP
    - Stateless:
        - It does not keep track of its state or any previous interaction.
        - There is no memory expenditure.
        - Any request is a new request.

    - The way protocols are being used has changed. Over different layers.
    - Difficult to change the Application and Transportation layer.

    - Local Storage:
        - Cookies
        - Flask (GONE)
