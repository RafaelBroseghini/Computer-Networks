    - Base conversion.
        - When we reach base of conversion system minus 1, we switch to 10.
        - oct (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,20)
        - hex (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f,10,11)

        - Binary to decimal:
            - when you have a power of two, look at the binary.
            - power of two is a nice nnumber with lots of 0's.
            - power of two -1  is a nice nnumber with lots of 1's.

            - (2 -> base system, could be 8, 16 etc)^index + number at that index (reverse).
        
        - Decimal to binary:
            - Keep dividing until you reach one.

        - Binary to Hex: (2^4)
            - how many digits to represent one bit in hex?
            - split by the number of digits.
            - only works if you convert to a number system that is a power of the source.

        - How to add bin numbers?
            - simple arithmetic.
        
        - How to represent negatives in bin?
            - ones compliment.
                - flip every bit (0->1 1->0)
            - twos compliment.
                - do ones compliment.
                - add one to that number.

        - extract two right most digits:
            - do 
        
        - extract two first bits:
            - get len, shift len - 2 to the right.
            - make two first ones,rest zeros.
            - source >>
