Congestion Control:
    - Lost packets.
    - Long delays.


How can the sender tlimit the traffic rate?
    - Increase timeouts?

How can the sender perceive there is congestion?
    - Timeout.


Why can a packet can be lost?
    - Something got so filled up, that it dropped a packet.
    - Router is overwhelmed that it dropped a packet. (Congestion)

    - Corruption of the packet. Checksum does not match the expected
        value.

Flow Control comes from receiver. Congestion Control starts with sender.

Three ACKS gives a good indication that we have a problem. Let's resend that packet.


Tahoe:
    - stop completely.

Reno:
    - Send half of what we sent before.

16 - triple duplicated ack.

22- timeout.
