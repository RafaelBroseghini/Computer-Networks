Application Layer Protocol Needs

DNS:
    - If my local DNS does not know how to resolve a name, it contacts a higher hierarchy server.
    - Relies on the UDP protocol beacause often the server is local. Size of message is small and
    it is a simple message.

DNS flags:
    - Type A: We want to get back the IPv4 of the destination. 32 bits. Roughly 4 billion addresses.
    - Type AAAA: IPv6 - 128 bits. More than the numbers of atoms in the universe.
    - Type MX: Mail exchange. See the email server we are using.
    - Type NS: Name Server.

Format of the message (DNS Message):
    - Gets encapsulated inside a transport layer protocol.
    - UDP gets attached to it (8 bits long)
        - Port number is important: 53 (Official port number for DNS server.)
        - Total number of ports: 2 bytes. 2^16. (1 byte == 8 bits)
    - Protocol IP: Header -> Protocol:17(x11) = UDP
    - Protocol IP: Header -> Protocol:06(x06) = TCP
    - Ethernet Header: 
        - Type: IPv4.

HTTP: 
    - Needs reliability.
    - Identifies its TCP port: 80.
    - Relies on the HTTP protocol as it may receive many objects (page, css, js etc)
    - TCP is a way to establish connection. (3 way: want, yes I understand, ok connected)
