Pipelining:
    - Size/ bandiwth /( rtt + (size/bdwth) )
    - RTT drives utiliztion to 0

    - Go back n
    - Selective repeat.



Neither of them (UDP, TCP) corrects errors that occur in a packet.

UDP does not fix errors?
    - UCP does not do redo transmission.

Transmission Control Protocol:
    - You can have reliability. They must happen at the app layer.
    - App responsibility to retransmit it.
    - Connection oriented. 3 way handshake.

    - Point-to-Point
        - One process on one end and one process on the other end.

    - Reliable byte stream.
        - retransmission.

    - Full duplex:
        - Data can flow both ways.

    - Pipelined

    - Flow control:
        - Client, Server can slow down each other.
        - The receiver cannot process data that fast.
    
    - Congestion control:
        - There is a congestion in the network.
        - ROuter etc cannot trasmit data that fast.
        - Sender will slow down, no need to congest the network.


    - Sequence number and Acknowledgment:
        - Seq number is the byte stream number of the first byte in a segment.

    - TCP uses cumulative Acknowledgment.
        - Acks butes up to the first missing byte.
    
    - real relative sent by the server: (convert hex to dec)
        - SYN/ACK sequence. Three way handshake.

    - What is the throughput (bytes transferred per unit time) for the TCP connection?
        - stats/summary
        - summ all length up until http.

    - look for fin packet.
    
    - What is the minimum amount of available buffer space advertised at the received for the entire trace? Does the lack of receiver buffer space ever throttle the sender?
        - look at windown size.
        - see if that effected the next packet.
        
    - Many packets from the server have some random padding added at the end (## 6, 9, 12 etc.) Why packets need to be at least 60 bytes long?
        - more of ethernet question.

    - Packets #3 and #206 are smaller than 60 bytes and yet not padded. Why is that?
        - wireshark and stacks of protocol.

    - What is the indication that the file was transmitted successfully?
        - 200 response code.
    

    - Both will slow down the sender. (CT, FT)
